# Attention:  WIP!

Update it regularly to get new features done.

# Smooth autocomplete

Enable autocomplete **inside quotes** as you type. Otherwise you need to force autocomplete with `ctrl` + `space`.

```bash
# Default is `off`

"editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "strings": "on"
}
```

# Scan components

You do not need to do it manually.

But, just in case, you can hit `Voltage: Scan components` from the command palette.

#  Formatting

- It **DOES NOT** deal with formatting (for now).
- Let **PHP Intelephense** do it for `.blade.php` files.
