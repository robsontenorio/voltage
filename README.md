# Smooth autocomplete

Enable autocomplete **inside quotes** as you type. Otherwise you need to force autocomplete with `ctrl` + `space`.

```bash
# Default is `off`

"editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "strings": "on"
}
```

#  Formatting

- It **does not** deal with formatting.
- Let `PHP Intelephense` do it for `.bldade.php` files.

# Scan components

You don't need to do it manually. 

But, just in case, you can scan components again with `Voltage: Scan components` from the command palette.
