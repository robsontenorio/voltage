# Attention:  WIP!

Update it regularly to get new features done.

# Voltage

Livewire Volt + Blade Intellisense.

Autocomplete and "click to go" everywhere!

# Notes

### Smooth autocomplete

Enable autocomplete **inside quotes** as you type. Otherwise you need to force autocomplete with `ctrl` + `space`.

```bash
# Default is `off`

"editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "strings": "on"
}
```

### Scan components

After installing or updating composer dependencies, make sure to scan components again with `Voltage: Scan components` from the command palette.

###  Formatting

- It **does not** deal with formatting.
- Let **PHP Intelephense** do it for `.blade.php` files.
